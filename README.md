# TATADataChallenge

# IDEA:
Use a SoftMax regression with cross-entropy loss over the data we have. We want to optimize the User Rating, Percentile of users who rated (vs maximum), same set for critics, company, genre, etc versus LOCAL sales. The idea is that the venture capitalist inputs a percentile threshold (ie: I want the best x% of companies) and the regions they want to invest in, and the algorithm will comment on what are the optimal weights of each characteristic.

## TODO:
- read over data
- state assumptions we're making
- state what we're trying to find
- design model

### Lidia
- figure out how to import Excel in Python
- convert any non-numerical data to a numerical representation
### Sayan
- read through Theano

- make model
